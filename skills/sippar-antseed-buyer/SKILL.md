# Reaching Sippar's models on AntSeed

Sippar sells fourteen models on AntSeed. Each one is a provider's data or files served as the
provider returns them, with the source named on every page. This skill is about the transport:
how a request reaches the right seller with its arguments intact, and how to tell from the
answer that it did. What each model answers, and what you can do with it, is in its own skill:

| Model string | What it answers | Skill |
|---|---|---|
| `quicknode-blockchain-data` | live facts about one of 46 EVM chains, bought from QuickNode when you ask | the `quicknode-blockchain-data` skill |
| `nansen-crypto-screener` | the top token contracts on Solana, Ethereum, Base, BNB and Arbitrum, from Nansen, plus Nansen's perpetuals screener | the `nansen-crypto-screener` skill |
| `tavily-web-search` | a live web search with sources, from Tavily (directly, or via gedx402) | the `tavily-web-search` skill |
| `crypto-skills` | agent skills: our own, and CryptoSkill's registry of crypto skills, as their authors published them. Send a skill name, an id or two or three keywords as the message, never a sentence | the `crypto-skills` skill |
| `sippar-skills` | the aggregator: our own, skills.sh's directory (every domain) and CryptoSkill's registry, as their authors published them. Send a skill name, an id (`owner/repo/skill` or `category/name`) or two or three keywords, never a sentence | the `sippar-skills` skill; `sippar-skill-adapter` to run one on AntSeed |
| `sippar-x-social` | public X (Twitter) posts on any subject matching a search, from glim.sh. Send keywords, names or X operators, never a sentence | the `sippar-x-social` skill |
| `sippar-flight-search` | Google Flights fares for one route and date, via stabletravel.dev. Send one line, `FROM TO DATE [RETURN-DATE] [ADULTS]` with airport codes, never a sentence | the `sippar-flight-search` skill |
| `sippar-linkedin-social` | public LinkedIn posts matching a search, from Social Fetch: link, date, author and counts per post, no post text. Send keywords; `posts` and `cursor` go inside the message text as JSON | the `sippar-linkedin-social` skill |
| `sippar-github` | public GitHub from glim.sh: a repository, a folder's file list, a file, an issue or PR, commits, releases, code search. Send a ref (`owner/repo`, a github.com URL) or a GitHub search; `repo`, `kind`, `per_page` and `page` go inside the message text as JSON | the `sippar-github` skill |
| `sippar-reddit-social` | public Reddit posts matching a search, from glim.sh: title, thread link, subreddit, author, date, score and comment count per post, no post text or comments. Send keywords; `time` and `cursor` go inside the message text as JSON | the `sippar-reddit-social` skill |
| `sippar-hotel-search` | places to stay for one search, from Google Maps via OpenWeb Ninja: type, stars, rating, amenities, address and Google's current nightly price; end the line with `offers` for each booking site's price | the `sippar-hotel-search` skill |
| `sippar-amazon` | Amazon from glim.sh: products for a search or `bestsellers:<category>` on six marketplaces, or one product's offer, other sellers and top reviews by ASIN or product URL; options in a JSON message | the `sippar-amazon` skill |
| `sippar-facebook-social` | Facebook via Social Fetch, as returned: Ad Library ads by keyword, or `"by": "company"` for one company's ads (long pages, about 18,000 to 80,000 tokens), or `"by": "page"` with a facebook.com page link for its recent posts; filters and `cursor` go inside the message text as JSON | the `sippar-facebook-social` skill |
| `sippar-news-search` | news from Google News via OpenWeb Ninja, each article cut to headline, publisher, date, link and snippet, no article text. Send one line: a search of the past week, `headlines` for the day's top stories, or `headlines business` (or another of eight topics) | the `sippar-news-search` skill |

Two models also answer under their earlier ids, with the same data, arguments and rate:
`sippar-chain-state` (now `quicknode-blockchain-data`) and `onchain-token-rankings` (now
`nansen-crypto-screener`). Use the new ids. `sippar-skills` is not an old id of `crypto-skills`:
it is the aggregator model, and `crypto-skills` the CryptoSkill-only one.

Seller peer `706fca9c0d0684c30f86209aae0c3565ce1aa69f`, onchain agent 84918, settled in USDC on
Base through your AntSeed payment channel. You pay per output token at the rate on the peer
record. Rates change, so read them rather than copying a number:

```bash
antseed network peer 706fca9c0d0684c30f86209aae0c3565ce1aa69f
```

## 1. Pin the peer

Buyer auto-selection does not necessarily route to this seller, so name it. A script or an
agent should pin per request, which needs no CLI and changes nothing shared:

```
x-antseed-pin-peer: 706fca9c0d0684c30f86209aae0c3565ce1aa69f
```

The other ways: put the seller address in the model string
(`"model": "0x706FCA9C0d0684C30F86209AAe0c3565cE1aa69F@quicknode-blockchain-data"`), set a session pin
with the CLI (`antseed buyer connection set --peer 706fca9c…`, bare id without `0x`), or pick
`Sippar Onchain Data` on the desktop app's Discover screen. If your wallet belongs to the desktop
app, most `antseed buyer` commands will not run against it; pin from the app or per request.

Free preflight, which calls no model:

```bash
antseed network peer 706fca9c0d0684c30f86209aae0c3565ce1aa69f
antseed buyer connection get
```

## 2. Send the chat-completions shape

This seller advertises one API protocol, `openai-chat-completions`. Post to
`/v1/chat/completions` on your AntSeed endpoint, which is one of two things:

- **Your own buyer proxy**, the usual setup: `127.0.0.1:8377` by default (`antseed buyer start
  --port` moves it). No key.
- **An AntSeed API-key gateway**, AntSeed's multi-user setup, where one buyer serves many people
  and each has their own key, limits and wallet. Send `Authorization: Bearer <your key>` to the
  gateway's address. If `ANTSEED_BASE_URL` and `ANTSEED_API_KEY` are set in your environment,
  that is your endpoint: post to `$ANTSEED_BASE_URL/chat/completions` with that key, not to
  8377. You need no `antseed` command and no buyer of your own. The pin, the arguments and the
  channels below work unchanged.

Any OpenAI-compatible client works on its chat-completions path.

Arguments are top-level keys in the request body, beside `model` and `messages`:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8377/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-antseed-pin-peer: 706fca9c0d0684c30f86209aae0c3565ce1aa69f' \
  -d '{
    "model": "quicknode-blockchain-data",
    "network": "base",
    "fields": ["blockNumber", "gasPrice"],
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "chain state"}]
  }'
```

Through a key gateway it is the same body, sent to the gateway with your key:

```bash
curl "$ANTSEED_BASE_URL/chat/completions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ANTSEED_API_KEY" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-antseed-pin-peer: 706fca9c0d0684c30f86209aae0c3565ce1aa69f' \
  -d '{"model": "sippar-flight-search", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "TLV BER 2026-10-20 1"}]}'
```

Behind a gateway, the `antseed` commands elsewhere in this skill (rates, preflight, activity)
are optional: the request needs only the endpoint, your key and the pin. `GET
$ANTSEED_BASE_URL/models` lists what the gateway's buyer can reach, and `GET
$ANTSEED_BASE_URL/key` shows your own spend and limits.

From the OpenAI Python SDK that is `extra_body={"network": "base", "fields": [...]}` on
`chat.completions.create`. The SDK flattens `extra_body` into the body. If you write the JSON
yourself, put the arguments at the top level: a literal `"extra_body": {...}` key is refused
with a free 400 that says so.

**Do not post to `/v1/messages` or `/v1/responses` with arguments.** The buyer proxy translates
those shapes by rebuilding the body from a fixed key list, and your arguments are not on it.
They are dropped silently, you are served the default page, and you pay for it.

## 3. If your client translates, use a channel that survives

Two channels cross every translation the proxy performs, and every Sippar model reads both.
Under `metadata`, namespaced:

```json
"metadata": {"sippar": {"network": "base", "fields": ["blockNumber", "gasPrice"]}}
```

Or as headers, one per argument, `x-sippar-<argument>`:

```
x-sippar-network: base
x-sippar-fields: blockNumber,gasPrice
```

A header carries text, so a list is comma-separated there and an object (`rpc`) is its JSON as a
string. Under `metadata` a list may be a list. A top-level argument, when it reaches the seller,
wins over both. Every argument of every model rides these channels under its own name.

Neither channel is documented by the marketplace. Both are measured to survive, not promised
to; the check is free and offline (section 7).

## 4. Or fail closed, for free

```
x-antseed-required-parameters: network,fields
```

With this header the proxy refuses any call that would need a translation, before routing and
before payment, with `422 required_capability_unavailable`. A call that needs no translation is
unaffected. It buys you a refusal, not an answer, so prefer section 3.

Two rules. It checks what the seller announces, not what your body contains, so a misspelled
key still gets served and billed. And require only what the model announces:
`quicknode-blockchain-data` announces `address, blocks, fields, network, rpc, tokens`;
`nansen-crypto-screener` announces `chains, rows, sort, symbols, timeframe, view`; `tavily-web-search`
announces `include_images, max_results`; `crypto-skills`, `sippar-skills`, `sippar-x-social`, `sippar-flight-search`, `sippar-linkedin-social`, `sippar-github`, `sippar-reddit-social`, `sippar-hotel-search`, `sippar-amazon`, `sippar-facebook-social` and `sippar-news-search` announce nothing, so requiring any name on them refuses every call. Read the current lists:

```bash
antseed network peer 706fca9c0d0684c30f86209aae0c3565ce1aa69f --json \
  | jq '.peer.providerServiceCapabilities.openai.services | map_values(.supportedParameters)'
```

## 5. At most 8 calls in flight

The seller serves at most 8 calls at once per buyer, across all fourteen models together. The
ninth is refused with `429 buyer_concurrency_limit` and `retry-after: 1`; nothing is served and
nothing is billed. The peer record's `maxConcurrency` is the node's ceiling, not this number. A
sweep over many chains runs in batches of 8 or fewer, with a retry on 429.

## 6. Read the routing line before you use the answer

Every `quicknode-blockchain-data` page carries a routing line, and the same facts under `routing` in
its JSON:

```
routing: mode=declared  network=base  confidence=n/a  source=network-field
```

`mode=declared` means your `network` arrived and selected the chain; `source` names the channel
(`network-field`, `network-meta`, `network-hdr`). `mode=default` means nothing arrived and you
are looking at Ethereum, billed in full. Check this in code before consuming the page. It is the
one signal that catches both a translated request and your own typo.

A refusal from the listing is an HTTP 400 whose message says what is accepted. On an open
channel it bills nothing: measured at zero on the ledger, against a response header that claimed
otherwise. Cost a call from your ledger (`antseed buyer activity`), never from
`x-antseed-estimated-cost-usd`.

## 7. Verify the shape rule yourself, free

```bash
node tools/check-argument-survival.mjs
```

Runs offline against the `@antseed/api-adapter` package your buyer already has, prints which
protocol pairs keep a top-level argument and which channels cross a translation, and exits
non-zero if the behaviour has moved.
