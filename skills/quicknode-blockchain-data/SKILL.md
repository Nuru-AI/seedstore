# quicknode-blockchain-data

Live facts about one chain, bought from QuickNode at the moment you ask and passed through
unchanged. Every page names QuickNode as the source. Transport (pin, request shape, the two
surviving channels, the 8-in-flight limit) is in the `sippar-antseed-buyer` skill; read
it first. Model string: `quicknode-blockchain-data`. The earlier id `sippar-chain-state` still
answers with the same data, arguments and rate.

## What it answers

| Ask about | Fields on the page |
|---|---|
| Network fees | `gasPrice`, `baseFeePerGas`, `maxPriorityFeePerGas` |
| Network activity | `blockNumber`, `blockTimestamp`, `blockTransactionCount`, `blockGasUsed`, `blockGasLimit`, `chainId` |
| Balances held by well-known protocol contracts | `nativeBalance`, `erc20Balance`, `transactionCount` |
| One account you name | `addressNativeBalance`, `addressErc20Balance`, `addressTransactionCount` |
| That account's transactions in the newest block | `addressBlocksScanned`, `addressTxCount`, `addressTxSent`, `addressTxReceived`, `addressTxRowsWithheld` |
| That account's balance of any ERC-20 you name | `addressTokenBalance`, `addressTokenDecimals` |
| A token's transfer logs, or every token a wallet sent or received | the `rpc` answer, QuickNode's reply to `eth_getLogs` |
| A block's header and its transaction hashes | the `rpc` answer, QuickNode's reply to `eth_getBlockByNumber` |
| One transaction's receipt: status, gas used, effective gas price, its logs | the `rpc` answer, QuickNode's reply to `eth_getTransactionReceipt` |
| One transaction itself: from, to, value, input, nonce, block | the `rpc` answer, QuickNode's reply to `eth_getTransactionByHash` |
| An account's native balance at any block, including old ones | the `rpc` answer, QuickNode's reply to `eth_getBalance` |
| The calls and internal transfers that touched a wallet, including native coin a contract sent it | the `rpc` answer, QuickNode's reply to `trace_filter` |
| What a contract's read-only function returned at any block, such as a token balance then | the `rpc` answer, QuickNode's reply to `eth_call` |

**Chains: `rpc` commands run on 46 (2026-10-09)**, each answered exactly as QuickNode returns
it. Name the chain with `network`; QuickNode's own network name is accepted too (`hype-mainnet`,
`sei-pacific`, `avalanche-mainnet`):

ethereum, base, arbitrum, bnb, polygon, optimism, blast, celo, mantle, unichain, ink, soneium,
world chain, gnosis, scroll, linea, fantom, sonic, berachain, monad, 0g, abstract, arc, avalanche,
b3, cyber, flare, flow (Flow EVM), fraxtal, gravity (Gravity Alpha), hemi, hyperevm, imx, joc, kaia,
lisk, mode, morph, arbitrum-nova, peaq, plasma, sei, story, tempo, vana, xlayer, xrplevm, zksync.

**The summary page is an extra on the first 20** (ethereum to monad). A request without `rpc`
gets it: the fields in the table above, which Sippar reads from QuickNode in several requests and
lays out as rows (QuickNode's raw integer stays in `valueRaw`). On the other 26 a request without
`rpc` is refused free, with a message saying that chain serves `rpc` commands only.

A chain the model does not serve is refused with a free 400.

## The six arguments

All six are optional top-level keys, all announced in `supportedParameters`.

| Argument | What it does |
|---|---|
| `network` | Which chain, any of the 46. **Omit it and you get Ethereum**, in full, billed in full, with no error. On the 26 chains without the summary page, send `rpc` beside it. |
| `fields` | Which rows you pay for. Omit it and you get every row. The legal names are on every narrowed page as `selection.fieldsAvailable`. |
| `address` | A `0x` + 40 hex account. Adds that account's three rows beside the chain's. Makes the page wider, so name `fields` to keep it narrow. Mixed case is checked as an EIP-55 checksum before anything is bought. |
| `blocks` | With `address`: scan that account's transactions in the newest block. Capped at 1; older blocks are not served by this field. |
| `tokens` | With `address`: up to 10 ERC-20 contracts, as a list or a comma string. Two rows per contract, the balance in the token's smallest unit and the contract's own `decimals()`. A contract that does not answer shows as failed, never as zero. A contract already on the chain's own token list is not read here: sent alone it is refused free with a note; sent beside other contracts it is silently left out. For those, ask for `addressErc20Balance` in `fields` instead. |
| `rpc` | One read-only QuickNode command, answered as QuickNode returns it: `eth_getLogs` (transfer logs), `eth_getBlockByNumber` (a block), `eth_getTransactionReceipt` (a receipt), `eth_getTransactionByHash` (a transaction), `eth_getBalance` (a native balance at a block), `trace_filter` (the traces that touched a wallet) or `eth_call` (a contract's read-only answer at a block). Send it alone. `network` is needed only for a chain other than Ethereum: without it, `rpc` runs on Ethereum and is billed. |

Example, two fields on Base:

```json
{"model": "quicknode-blockchain-data", "network": "base", "fields": ["blockNumber", "gasPrice"],
 "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "chain state"}]}
```

Example, one account on Arbitrum, only its own rows:

```json
{"model": "quicknode-blockchain-data", "network": "arbitrum",
 "address": "0x…", "fields": ["addressNativeBalance", "addressErc20Balance", "addressTransactionCount"],
 "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "chain state"}]}
```

Through a translating client, the same arguments go under `metadata.sippar` or as
`x-sippar-network`, `x-sippar-fields`, `x-sippar-address`, `x-sippar-blocks`, `x-sippar-tokens`,
`x-sippar-rpc` (the main skill, section 3).

## `rpc`: one QuickNode command

Read-only QuickNode commands, opened one at a time, each answered exactly as QuickNode returns it
under a line saying what was read and when. On 2026-10-09 there were seven: `eth_getLogs`,
`eth_getBlockByNumber`, `eth_getTransactionReceipt`, `eth_getTransactionByHash`, `eth_getBalance`,
`trace_filter`, `eth_call`. **The live list is
in the refusal:** a command the listing does not serve is refused free with a message naming every
command it does serve, so send one when you need to know. Every command that writes is refused.
**All seven are proven on Ethereum (2026-10-09).** On another chain, a command may not be
served, and old-block (archive) reads and traces vary most from chain to chain. An unsupported
command comes back as QuickNode's own error, unchanged. On the 26 chains added on 2026-10-09 (0g to zksync above), each answers
`eth_chainId` with its own chain id, and `eth_getBlockByNumber` is proven on zksync; nothing else
is proven there yet. flow and gravity, added on 2026-10-19, answer `eth_chainId` with 747 and 1625. The `rpc` object may be at most 1,000 bytes.

The same command on another chain, here the newest block on zkSync:

```json
{"model": "quicknode-blockchain-data", "network": "zksync",
 "rpc": {"method": "eth_getBlockByNumber", "params": ["latest", false]},
 "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "chain state"}]}
```

### `eth_getLogs`: transfer logs for a token, or for a wallet

A token's transfers, by its contract `address`:

```json
{"model": "quicknode-blockchain-data", "network": "ethereum",
 "rpc": {"method": "eth_getLogs",
         "params": [{"address": "0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48",
                     "topics": ["0xddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef"],
                     "fromBlock": "0x15f9000", "toBlock": "0x15f9010"}]},
 "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "chain state"}]}
```

Every token a wallet received, by naming the wallet instead of a contract. The wallet goes in topic
position 2 (received) or 1 (sent), written as a 32-byte topic: `0x`, then 24 zeros, then the
wallet's 40 hex characters. Here, transfers to `0xd8da6bf2…6045`:

```json
{"model": "quicknode-blockchain-data", "network": "ethereum",
 "rpc": {"method": "eth_getLogs",
         "params": [{"topics": ["0xddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef",
                                null,
                                "0x000000000000000000000000d8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045"],
                     "fromBlock": "0x15f9000", "toBlock": "0x15f9010"}]},
 "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "chain state"}]}
```

- `params` is one filter object with the keys `address`, `topics`, `fromBlock`, `toBlock`,
  `blockHash`. It must name a contract `address` (one, or a list) or a wallet in topic 1 or 2;
  a filter with neither is refused free with a message showing both forms.
- You are billed for the tokens you receive, and each log is about 160 of them. One block of a
  busy token can run past ten thousand, so name a narrow range by absolute block number rather
  than `latest`.
- **When the answer is wider than one page**, the page serves the first logs that fit, unchanged
  and in QuickNode's order, cut on a block boundary. Two lines above the JSON say how many logs
  QuickNode returned, how many this page serves, and the exact `fromBlock` to send next, so no
  log is repeated. When one block alone is wider than a page, the lines say so and ask for a
  narrower `topics` filter with `fromBlock` and `toBlock` both set to that block.

### `eth_getBlockByNumber`: a block's header and transaction hashes

```json
{"model": "quicknode-blockchain-data", "network": "base",
 "rpc": {"method": "eth_getBlockByNumber", "params": ["latest", false]},
 "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "chain state"}]}
```

- Exactly two params: the block (`latest`, `earliest`, `safe`, `finalized`, or a `0x` block
  number) and `false`. The block comes back with its transaction hashes, not full transactions;
  anything else is refused free.
- A block that does not exist yet (a number past the chain's head) comes back as QuickNode's `null`,
  with a line saying the network has no block with that number yet.
- **When the block is wider than one page**, the header (`number`, `hash`, `timestamp` and every
  other field) is whole and the transaction hashes are cut to the first that fit, in QuickNode's
  order, with a line above the JSON saying how many there were.

### `eth_getTransactionReceipt`: one transaction's receipt

```json
{"model": "quicknode-blockchain-data", "network": "ethereum",
 "rpc": {"method": "eth_getTransactionReceipt",
         "params": ["0x<the transaction hash: 64 hex characters>"]},
 "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "chain state"}]}
```

- Exactly one param: the transaction hash, `0x` and 64 hex characters. Anything else is refused
  free.
- The receipt carries `status`, `gasUsed`, `effectiveGasPrice` and the transaction's logs, as
  QuickNode returns them.
- **When the receipt is wider than one page**, every field is whole except `logs`, which is cut to
  the first that fit, in QuickNode's order, with a line above the JSON saying how many there were.

### `eth_getTransactionByHash`: one transaction

```json
{"model": "quicknode-blockchain-data", "network": "ethereum",
 "rpc": {"method": "eth_getTransactionByHash",
         "params": ["0x<the transaction hash: 64 hex characters>"]},
 "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "chain state"}]}
```

- Exactly one param: the transaction hash. Anything else is refused free.
- The transaction comes back as QuickNode returns it: `from`, `to`, `value`, `input`, `nonce`,
  `blockNumber` and the rest.
- **When `input` is too long for one page**, every other field is whole and `input` is served as an
  exact slice of QuickNode's string. A line above the JSON says which characters this page holds
  and what to send next: the same request with `"inputFrom": <number>` inside `rpc`. The slices,
  joined in order, are the whole value.

### `eth_getBalance`: an account's native balance at a block

```json
{"model": "quicknode-blockchain-data", "network": "ethereum",
 "rpc": {"method": "eth_getBalance",
         "params": ["0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045", "0xe4e1c0"]},
 "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "chain state"}]}
```

- Exactly two params: the account (`0x` and 40 hex characters) and the block (`latest`, `earliest`,
  `safe`, `finalized`, or a `0x` block number). `pending`, a decimal number or a block object is
  refused free.
- Old blocks work: the example asks for block 15,000,000 (`0xe4e1c0`).
- The answer is QuickNode's single hex quantity, in wei, unchanged.

### `trace_filter`: the calls and internal transfers that touched a wallet

A token's logs do not show native coin that a contract sends, such as ETH paid out by a router
or a bridge. Traces do. Here, every trace sent to `0xd8da6bf2…6045` over a block range, at most 20:

```json
{"model": "quicknode-blockchain-data", "network": "ethereum",
 "rpc": {"method": "trace_filter",
         "params": [{"toAddress": ["0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045"],
                     "fromBlock": "0x18efbf4", "toBlock": "0x18efc58", "count": 20}]},
 "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "chain state"}]}
```

- `params` is one filter object. It must name a wallet in `fromAddress` (sent) or `toAddress`
  (received), each a list of `0x` addresses. The optional keys are `fromBlock` and `toBlock`
  (`latest`, `earliest`, `safe`, `finalized`, or a `0x` block number), `after` (how many traces
  to skip), `count` (at most this many, above 0) and `mode` (`union` or `intersection`, for a
  filter that names both). Any other key, or a filter with no wallet, is refused free with a
  message naming the keys.
- The answer is QuickNode's list of traces, unchanged and in QuickNode's order.
- **When the answer is wider than one page**, the page serves the first traces that fit. A line
  above the JSON says how many traces QuickNode returned and how many this page serves, and the
  next line gives the `after` to send: the same request with that `"after"` in the filter. No
  trace is served twice. This is QuickNode's own paging.
- Name a narrow block range and a `count`: a busy wallet can have more traces than one page
  holds.

### `eth_call`: a contract's read-only answer at a block

Runs a contract's read-only function at the block you name, as of that block. Nothing is sent to
the chain. Here, USDC's `balanceOf(0xd8da6bf2…6045)` at block 15,000,000:

```json
{"model": "quicknode-blockchain-data", "network": "ethereum",
 "rpc": {"method": "eth_call",
         "params": [{"to": "0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48",
                     "data": "0x70a08231000000000000000000000000d8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045"},
                    "0xe4e1c0"]},
 "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "chain state"}]}
```

- Exactly two params: a call object and a block (`latest`, `earliest`, `safe`, `finalized`, or a
  `0x` block number). The call object takes `to` (the contract, `0x` and 40 hex characters,
  required), `data` (the encoded function call, even-length `0x` hex) and `from`. `gas`, `value`
  or any other key is refused free with a message naming the three it takes.
- The answer is QuickNode's reply, unchanged: the function's return value as hex. A call that
  reverts is served as QuickNode returns the revert.
- A typical read is the one above: an ERC-20 `balanceOf` at a past block.
- **When `result` is too long for one page**, every other field is whole and `result` is served as
  an exact slice of QuickNode's string. A line above the JSON says which characters this page holds
  and what to send next: the same request with `"resultFrom": <number>` inside `rpc`. The slices,
  joined in order, are the whole value. `resultFrom` is accepted on `eth_call` only.

### Sui: Sui's own commands, with `"network": "sui"`

Sui is not an EVM chain, so it takes its own read-only commands instead of `eth_*`, each answered
as QuickNode returns it: `sui_getLatestCheckpointSequenceNumber`, `suix_getReferenceGasPrice`,
`sui_getChainIdentifier`, `sui_getCheckpoint` (a sequence number as a decimal string),
`suix_getAllBalances` and `suix_getBalance` (an owner, `0x` and 64 hex; `suix_getBalance` also takes
a coin type), `suix_getCoinMetadata` and `suix_getTotalSupply` (a coin type such as
`0x2::sui::SUI`), and `sui_getTransactionBlock` (a digest, and optionally `showInput`,
`showEffects`, `showEvents`, `showBalanceChanges`, `showObjectChanges`). Here, the latest checkpoint:

```json
{"model": "quicknode-blockchain-data", "network": "sui",
 "rpc": {"method": "sui_getLatestCheckpointSequenceNumber", "params": []},
 "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "chain state"}]}
```

- A Sui command without `"network": "sui"`, or an `eth_*` command with it, is refused free.
- Sui retired its JSON-RPC, so each Sui command is answered from QuickNode's Sui GraphQL, served as
  QuickNode returns it: `response` is a GraphQL body (`data`, plus `errors` when there are any), and
  the answer carries `"via": "graphql"`. Lists stop at 50 entries and say whether there are more.

## Reading the page

The page is a markdown table for a person with the same rows fenced as JSON beneath it for a
program, then the source line and notes. Parse the JSON; pass the table through as it arrives;
keep the notes and the attribution.

- `routing.mode` must be `declared` before you trust which chain you got (main skill, section 6).
- Rows are keyed by `(metric, target, asset)`. `addressErc20Balance` and `erc20Balance` are one
  row per token. There is no `address` key on a row; the subject is `target`.
- `value` is already human-readable. `valueRaw` is QuickNode's unscaled integer and `decimals`
  is what `value` was scaled by. Gas rows are in wei; `unit` says so.
- `ok: false` with a `reason` (`no-response`, `no-result`, `provider-error`) marks a row that
  could not be answered. It keeps its slot. The page is billed for the output tokens it carries,
  so read `counts.rowsFailed` before you treat a page as complete.
- `coverage` states what the page does not claim: balances only, no prices, no history, the
  `latest` block (not finalized), and a token balance is the contract's ledger entry, not proof
  of who controls the address.
- `addressTransactionCount` counts transactions the account sent, so it is lower than a block
  explorer's count.
- With no `address`, the balance rows are a fixed set of published protocol contracts, labelled
  in `targetLabel`. They are not a wallet.
- The notes stop a model from reading a correct outlier as corrupt data. One chain's real gas
  limit looks absurd if you do not know that chain.

## Cost

Per output token at the rate on the peer record. Naming `fields` is what makes a call cheap:
measured 2026-09-24, a dropped `fields` costs about 7.6 times what the same call costs with two
rows named, and one row still costs about 13% of the full page because the envelope and notes
are most of a small answer. An `address` makes the page wider; `fields` narrows it again. A
refusal bills nothing on an open channel.

## Changes

- 3.6.2 (2026-10-22): Sui commands answered from Sui GraphQL, since Sui's JSON-RPC is retired.
- 3.6.1 (2026-10-21): `rpc` without `network` runs on Ethereum, stated plainly.
- 3.6.0 (2026-10-21): Sui, with its own read-only commands.
- 3.5.1 (2026-10-09): `rpc` stated as the way in on all 46 chains; the summary page is an extra on
  the first 20.
- 3.5.0 (2026-10-09): `rpc` on 26 more chains with no page (`rpc`-only), from avalanche to zksync.
- 3.4.1 (2026-10-09): removed the price-feed example from `eth_call`.
- 3.4.0 (2026-10-09): `eth_call`, a contract's read-only answer at any block, with long results
  served in slices.
- 3.3.0 (2026-10-09): `trace_filter`, the calls and internal transfers that touched a wallet,
  with wide answers resumed by `after`.
- 3.2.0 (2026-10-08): `eth_getBalance`, an account's native balance at any block.
- 3.1.0 (2026-10-08): `eth_getTransactionByHash`, with long `input` served in slices; where to read
  the live command list.
- 3.0.0 (2026-10-08): the model is `quicknode-blockchain-data` (the old id `sippar-chain-state`
  still answers). `rpc` adds wallet-filtered `eth_getLogs`, `eth_getBlockByNumber` and
  `eth_getTransactionReceipt`.
- 2.0.0 (2026-10-08): own skill. Added `rpc` and its served-in-part page, `tokens`, the partial
  page rule, and the wei note.
